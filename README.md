# üìô Amazon Book Reviews: Sentiment Analysis using Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark

This project focuses on efficiently processing and analysing a large dataset of Amazon book reviews to extract key sentiment insights. Using predefined positive and negative word sets tailored for book reviews, each review is classified as positive, neutral, or negative, enabling the calculation of total reviews, average sentiment scores, and counts for each sentiment category. Leveraging distributed computing, we implement the analysis using both Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark (PySpark) to handle the dataset‚Äôs massive scale, ensuring faster processing compared to traditional methods. The project also compares the two frameworks in terms of implementation complexity, execution efficiency, and output accuracy, providing guidance on the most effective approach for large-scale sentiment analysis in the e-commerce domain.
